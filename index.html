<p STYLE="font-family: Courier, 'Courier New', monospace">I was born on February 3rd, 2000 in Atlanta,GA in the middle of an ice storm. My father was born in a small town in Colombia and my mother was born in Queens, New York. However, my mother's parents are from Colombia and she spent many of her childhood years in Colombia with her family. I have two siblings: an older brother and a younger sister. Growing up as the middle child was interesting because I always looked up to my older brother who was always very successful. While I was trying to model myself after him, I also had to set a good example for my younger sister. Although we never always got along I was able to guide her and tell her the rights from wrongs. I believe my family has a very strong relationship and that they have shaped me into the man I am today.</p>

<p STYLE="font-family: Courier, 'Courier New', monospace">During my high school years, I was very active. I was named to the Principal's list all four years and I graduated with the International Baccalaureate diploma. I served as President of my school's Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter during my senior year. Outside of the classroom I was also very active as I played football and soccer all four years and was on both Varsity teams beginning my sophomore year. During my junior year, I was named captain of the soccer team and I held the position through the end of my senior year. I believe this position helped me gain experience in knowledge in leading those around me and showing them how to be successful on and off the soccer field. For my leadership I was also named to the Student Athlete Leadership Team. </p>

<p STYLE="font-family: Courier, 'Courier New', monospace">One of the happiest days of my life was when I opened up my acceptance letter to the University of Georgia. Being a sophomore I can still remember the feeling that I got. Knowing that my brother had just graduated from UGA, I was so excited to go live the next four years of my life in Athens. I am currently a Sports Management major in the College of Education. During my freshman year I worked for the Recreational Sports department at Ramsey as a referee for many different intramural sports. I am currently a member of the Sigma Chi Delta Chapter here at the University of Georgia. The experiences I have had here in Athens have been worthwhile. There is nothing better than going to Sanford Stadium on a Saturday to watch the Dawgs play and scream with all my friends. I have enjoyed every minute of my experience here and I look forward to what the next two years have in store for me.</p>
